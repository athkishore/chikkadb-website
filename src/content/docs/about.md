title: What is ChikkaDB?
description: About ChikkaDB
---

ChikkaDB is a library and application built around SQLite, as a portable JSON database server. It translates MongoDB query language commands into SQLite's SQL dialect, enabling you to interact with JSON data in an SQLite database using MongoDB's API.

The ChikkaDB server is wire-compatible with `mongod`, which means you can connect to ChikkaDB using any of your favourite MongoDB clients or language drivers.

The name of the project is a tribute to the beautiful city of Bengaluru in the diverse southern Indian state of Karnataka. 'Chikka' in Kannada means 'small', 'little', 'young' (as in younger sibling), etc.

It is a lightweight, open-source alternative to MongoDB.
